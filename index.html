                OpenType features allow users to take their typography to the next level—but not everyone has a firm grasp of them. This article kicks off a series that will explain what OpenType features do and how to make the most of them.

                The introduction of the OpenType font format at the turn of the millennium took digital typefaces to an unprecedented level of sophistication. Contemporary fonts can accommodate close to 130,000 characters, and OpenType features lend them what seems to be artificial intelligence. For example, letters can spontaneously morph into alternate forms to produce the best possible typographic composition.
                <br/>

                Customer Advisory Board are bearing their first fruits, but many apps with typesetting capabilities still provide a rather basic or incomplete typographic interface, and additions to these interfaces are not always implemented in a logical way. This is one of the main reasons why many users remain unaware of the amazing possibilities of current OpenType fonts. This new series of posts will highlight the different OpenType features. We’ll explain what they do and how to access them so that you can get the most out of your fonts.

            <h1>Overview and sample code for accessing<br/>OpenType features in CSS</h1>
            <span class="description">
                The CSS3 Specification defines two ways of accessing OpenType features in CSS: <span class="bold">high-level</span> and <span class="bold">low-level</span> properties.
            </span>
            <section class="levels">
                <div class="level">
                    <h1>High-level</h1>
                    <span>
                        <span class="bold">High-level</span> properties are independent of font format and have semantic, human-readable names. The specification recommends authors to use these properties whenever possible – but not all browsers support them yet.
                    </span>
                </div>
                <div class="level">
                    <h1>Low-level</h1>
                    <span>
                        The <span class="bold">low-level</span> property font-feature-settings is specific to OpenType fonts. It offers an easy way to access OpenType features directly using standard 4-letter tags. This property is supported by the latest versions of all major browsers.
                    </span>
                </div>
            </section>
            <span class="description">
                The examples above use both the high-level and low-level CSS syntax, and include prefixed low-level syntax for older versions of Firefox and Webkit browsers.
